# CS4620 Final Project Starter Code


The example starter code under [./src/app/](./src/app/) is fairly well-commented and one of the best ways to get familiar with the codebase.

We will push additional feature skeleton code and examples from lecture, which you can check out on the [assignment repo](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/CS4620-F2022/final-project-starter-cs4620-fa22) or by pulling updated to this code.

As we add new example features and skeleton code, we will also describe them in the [course assignment docs](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4620/2022fa/assignments/docs/category/assignments).




*Note from Abe: Do not share the AniGraph source publicly. I do intend to open-source AniGraph eventually, but it is not yet public, and parts of the current version may be witheld so that they can be included in future assignments. You can, however, build a static version of your code to post online if you want to share what you have done with others.*
